- 👋 Hi, I’m @mbnLINK
- 👀 I’m interested in object-oriented programming mainly with C# and .NET languages, but I've also dabbled in both Objective-C and Swift for the iPhone. Besides that I do macro "programming" in Excel, and I can do websites in HTML, CSS and PHP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Revit API together with C#, while also upgrading my skills in DynamoForRevit. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Revit plugins and DynamoForRevit, and anything in programming related to my team at LINK Arkitektur. 
- 📫 How to reach me on mail: mbn@linkarkitektur.dk
